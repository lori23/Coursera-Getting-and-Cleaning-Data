# Coursera-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
This repository is created to submit project for coursera getting and cleaning data course

`run_analysis.R` contains all the code to perform the required analysis:
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names 
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

`CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data
